      While the world is talking about Data Science, Advanced Analytics and Robotics, major companies are still to understand the importance of their business data and how it can be used to understand their operations better. Data is hardly
      maintained and where Data is being maintained, invaluable effort and time is spent in preparing rudimentary reports for management only to find that the data was erroneous and not updated. Where data is updated, significant hours and effort is
      spent in repeating the same procedures for data preparation. <br><br />

      Leadership is not aware of simpler solutions and the problem is either too small for large players to take on or too expensive for businesses to invest.<br /> <br />

      My consulting company <em><a href="https://www.passionData.in"><em></em><strong>PassionData Solutions</strong></a></em> focussing on providing simple and cost-effective solutions in the field of Data Management, Data Processing and Intelligent
      Reporting to the small and medium scale business, providing return on investment through savings in effort and productivity and helping realize the value of their data to make informed decisions.
