    <h3> Firm's Risk Assessment Tool</h3>
<p>
The Crowe Global Firm's Risk Assessment Tool (<em>FRAP Tool</em>) is an integrated Quality Management compliance resource that enables all firms to document their compliance with the requirements for their System of Quality Management (SOQM). The Tool can be used by all firms to document compliance with Crowe Global Network Requirements (as presented in Chapter 12 of the Membersâ€™ Rulebook) and for audit firms to comply with ISQM 1. The Tool combines documentation of compliance with individual requirements and the preparation of the Quality Management risk assessment (the FRAP). In 2023 the Tool will be upgraded to assist firms with their Monitoring and Remediation, and Evaluation, of their SOQM.
